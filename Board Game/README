When running from the command line, Scoreboard.ser is instead read from and written to out/production/Simon-Race/Scoreboard.seq
The libraries used for this project are corretto-1.8_352 and Junit5.8.1, though any version of java 1.8 with support for JavaFX should work. The required libraries are also specified in the Simons-Race.iml file included.
